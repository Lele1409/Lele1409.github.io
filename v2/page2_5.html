        Python, the most beginner friendly programming language in existence. So many possibilities and so much I have already done. If you want to know more about what I did with Python look at the <a href="index.html#projects">projects page</a>.

    <h2>
        Python
    </h2>
    Python is a widely-used high-level programming language that is known for its simplicity and readability. It was first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum and has since grown in popularity, particularly in the fields of data science, artificial intelligence, and web development.
    <br><br>
    One of the key strengths of Python is its vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that make it easy to perform a wide range of tasks. For example, the popular library NumPy is used for scientific computing, and the web framework Django is often used for web development. This makes Python a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of projects.
    <br><br>
    Python is also widely used in data science and machine learning, thanks to its powerful data manipulation capabilities and libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. These libraries make it easy to perform complex data analysis, create machine learning models and deep learning models.
    <br><br>
    Another benefit of Python is its active and supportive community. There are many resources available, such as tutorials, documentation, and forums, which can help beginners and experienced programmers alike.
    <br><br>
    In addition to its popularity in the fields of data science and machine learning, Python is also widely used in web development, automation, scripting, and even as a general-purpose programming language. Its simplicity, readability and the ability to work with multiple programming paradigms make it a great choice for beginners and experts alike.
    <br><br>
    Many organizations, such as Google, NASA, and Spotify, use Python in their technology stack, and it is also taught in many universities and coding bootcamps as a first language. Python is also open-source, which means that it is free to use and can be modified by anyone.
    <br><br>
    It's important to note that Python has some limitations, such as its performance when compared to low-level languages like C or C++. However, Python's ease of use and the wealth of available libraries and frameworks make it a great choice for a wide range of tasks.

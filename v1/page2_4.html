	<h2>
		Bitcoin
	</h2>
		Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that allows for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a central authority. It was created in 2009 by an unknown individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, which allows for transparency and security.
		<br><br>
		One of the key features of Bitcoin is its limited supply. There can only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence, and as of today, over 18 million have been mined. This scarcity is designed to protect the currency from inflation, and it is one of the reasons why many people see Bitcoin as a store of value.
		<br><br>
		Bitcoin can be bought and sold on various cryptocurrency exchanges, and it can also be used to purchase goods and services from merchants who accept it. In recent years, interest in Bitcoin has grown significantly, and it has become one of the most widely-traded cryptocurrencies in the world.
		<br><br>
		Bitcoin has sparked a revolution in the way we think about money, and it has inspired the creation of many other cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based projects. However, it is not without its controversies, and it has been criticized for its association with illegal activities and its high volatility.
		<br><br>
		Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has become a household name and it's been widely adopted by many people and institutions. Its decentralized nature, the transparency in the transactions, and the scarcity of the coin, makes it an attractive alternative for people who want to store value, transfer money, and be in control of their assets.
		<br><br>
		It's important to note that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are highly speculative assets and their value can fluctuate greatly. It's important to do your own research and understand the risks before investing in any cryptocurrency.
